# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## How to run this application?

You should download this repo, and open index.html file to run this application.
To check which tests were made open feedreader.js in your text editor to check how those tests were implemented.
